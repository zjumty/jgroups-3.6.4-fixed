	       Things to do before packaging a release
	       ---------------------------------------

Pre-release:
- Do a git pull origin master and commit all pending changes
- Run all unit tests: ./build clean all-tests reports
- Run the manual tests in doc/tests/ManualTests.txt
- Run the performance tests to see whether performance is about the same
  (see wiki http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PerfTests)


Release:
- Update the ReleaseNotes-xxx.txt for the given release
- Set version in: Version.java, build.xml and pom.xml
  * Note that the version needs to conform to the version standards, e.g. 2.6.2.GA or 2.6.4.CR2, 2.5.4.Beta1
- Create a Git tag: JGroups_x_y_z
- Create a distribution: ./build.sh jar
  - the distribution files are dist/jgroups-x.y.z.jar, dist/jgroups-sources.jar and dist/README
- Upload distribution files to web site:
  - Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/javagroups/files/ (requires admin)
- Create PDF and HTML documentation: ./build.sh docs and upload to web site
  - these files update the JGroups web page (http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/index.html),
    specifically the links to manual and tutorial documentation
  - see JGroups/bin/upload_manual.sh
- Create javadoc: ./build.sh javadoc and upload to web site
  - use process similar to pdf and html (script is bin/upload_javadocs.sh)
- Add new release binary jar *and* source jar to Nexus maven repository (http://repository.jboss.org/nexus)
  a. Run ./bin/release_to_nexus.sh (you need access permissions to Nexus)
  b. Go to Nexus: https://repository.jboss.org/nexus
  c. Log in (jboss.org login)
  d. Click on Staging repositories in the left hand pane
  e. Right click on the uploaded artifacts (JAR and src JAR) and either drop or promote them. In case of promotion,
     the artifacts will be promoted to the jboss-releases repository and removed from the staging repo
- Announcement to the jg-dev and jg-users mailing lists
  -include release notes and changelog


  NOTE: to perform these steps, you will need a SourceForge account and appropriate
  permissions.
